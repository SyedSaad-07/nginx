NGINX is a high performance web server.
-- Piece of software on a server, that handles HTTP requests.

-------
-- NGINX can act as a load balancer.

1) Distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend servers.
2) To balance the load, improve performance and provide redundancy.

--- Some load balancing methods: 
1) Least Connections:
    Routes traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
2) Round Robin:
    Distributes client requests in a sequential, cyclical manner to each server in the group.

--- Caching is a core feature of NGINX Proxy.

1) Caches responses from backend server for freqently accessd resources.
2) Copies are stored temporarily to improve the performance.

--- Secuirty

* Only one server that is publicly available *
1) Consolidated Secuirty.
2) Minimized Exposure
3) Centralized Access Control
4) Centralized Logging and Monitoring

Using NGINX Proxy significantly Reduces attack surface.

* NGINX can handle SSL/TLS encryption and decryption.
* If attracker intercepts message, they can't read it.

# Accept encrypted traffic.
# Deny non encrypted requests.

--- NGINX Proxy can compress the response.
    * To reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.

Segmentation - Sending response in chunks.

# Nginx as a K8s ingress Controller
A specialized load balancer for managing ingress ( incoming ) traffic in Kubernetes.

#Docker
1) Docker Image = Standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run the application.
2) It's a snapshot of an environment that can be used to create and run containers.

# Docker-Compose
) Tool to simplify the process of defining and running multiple containers.
